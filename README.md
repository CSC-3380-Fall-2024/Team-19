# Team-19
Front end ReadME: 

Frontend Setup

1. install Visual Studio Code IDE
2. Install Node.js LTS version(Version 22.12.0) from Nodejs.org and    follow installer steps Link: nodejs.org/en
3. Pull Suni project from Team-19 Github Repository
4. Open Terminal within VSCode (top left bar, New Terminal)
5. Navigate to Suni via ls/ cd commands in the terminal(start @Team-19 ->cd-> frontend ->cd-> Suni) (You wiil know you're within Suni frontend when you see package.json when doing ls command)
(Tip:^ use ls to see what’s in current directory(to find next destination), and use cd NameOfDirectory to move to it. Repeat this process as necessary)
6. Install dependencies(in terminal one at a time):
(Tip: on some Window’s systems, your execution policy may block this process. To fix it, open a separate powershell instance as an Administrator) 
  a. npm install
  b. npm install recharts 
  c. npm install --save-dev @types/recharts 
  d. npm install lucide-react
  e. npm install tailwindcss@latest (only once) (naybe remove)
  f. npm install @headlessui/react @heroicons/react (typescript CSS) (only once, maybe remove)
  g. npm install axios
  h. npm install react-big-calendar
  i. npm install @types/react-big-calendar
  j. npm install moment
  k. npm install jwt-decode
(Tip 2: if vulnerabilities are found, run npm audit fix to repair them. This should fix most errors, and respond with found 0 vulnerabilities)

7. Run Development Server (npm run dev)
8. A green VITE will appear, saying it is ready and providing a link to view the dev server. Open provided ^^ link(localhost/#### (often 5173 by default))

Most basic Troubleshooting:
Manually delete node_modules files from /Team-19/Suni/frontend/node_modules
Note: This file is generated by npm installs, and can be a source of most errors. Deleting it and reinstalling it with npm install can be a quick and easy fix for most errors found with npm install

Backend: 

(TIP: Run front end server FIRST, THEN run backend while leaving frontend server running) (ALSO, if front end done first, steps 2-3 can be skipped)

For windows:
1. Install python 3.13 from the Microsoft Store (Or else it won’t identify it in VSCode terminal)  Link:
2. Install Virtual Studio Code IDE (latest version) if not already installed Link:
3. Clone the repository folder (will be contributed as part of larger project pull) from Team-19 Github Repository
4. Open the project in Virtual Studio Code, and open a new terminal from the top right toolbar
(Terminal Tip: after typing out each command, hit enter to execute. It should show a loading animation, and you will be able to type the next command once the userpath shows again)
5. cd into backend directory through terminal with command (cd backend)
6. Within this new terminal, type in the command: python -m venv venv
(Tip: if a popup appears asking if a new environment was created and should be included in workplace environment folder, select Yes)
8. Activate the virtual environment with the command: venv/Scripts/activate
(Tip: you should see a light green (venv) appear before your user path in the terminal)
9. Cd back out of the backend directory into the main / starting place (Team-19) with command: (cd ..)
9. Install dependencies with command: pip install -r requirements.txt
(Tip: if your pip receives an error stating your version is out of date, follow the instructions with command: python.exe -m -pip install –upgrade pip, then try pip install again)
10. cd back into backend directory through terminal with command (cd backend)
11. Establish Database run migrations
First, type command: python manage.py makemigrations 
python manage.py migrate
12. Run the Development Server Start the server with command: 
python manage.py runserver
(Tip: you will know its started when it shows a start time and the option to quit. Open the dev server in your browser and refresh, allowing the use of both front and backend together properly)


For macOS
1. Install python 3.13 from python.org and follow the installer steps
2. Install Virtual Studio Code (latest version) if not already installed
3. Clone the repository folder (will be contributed as part of larger project pull) from Team-19 Github Repository
4. Open the project in Virtual Studio Code, and open a new terminal from the top right toolbar
5. Within this new terminal, type in the command: python3 -m venv venv ( if this doesn’t work, try python(instead of python3) instead.
6. Activate the virtual environment with the command: source venv/bin/activate
7. Install dependencies with command: pip install -r requirements.txt
8. Establish Database run migrations
    a. First, type command: python3 manage.py makemigrations 
    b. python3 manage.py migrate
9. Run the Development Server Start the server with command: 
    a. python3 manage.py runserver
(Tip: you will know its started when it shows a start time and the option to quit. Open the dev server in your browser and refresh, allowing the use of both front and backend together properly)

Both of these README sections will be independently available within both the frontend and backend folder for easy access
